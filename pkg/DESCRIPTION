Description: Implementation of selected high-dimensional statistical and econometric methods for estimation and inference. 
This package provides efficient estimators and  uniformly valid confidence intervals for various low-dimensional causal/structural parameters 
appearing in high-dimensional approximately sparse models. The package includes functions for fitting heteroscedastic robust Lasso regressions 
with non-Gaussian erros and for instrumental variable (IV) and treatment effect estimation in a high-dimensional setting. Moreover, the methods enable 
valid post-selection inference and rely on a theoretically grounded, data-driven choice of the penalty.

## Reported Bugs and new Features

* short-run goals:  
+ Formula interface for all functions (treatment family) ok
+ Quantile Effects  
+ Improvement speed and performance (rlasso -> use glmnet) (instable results)
+ Formula for rlasso/rlassologit and predict (Bug 2) (revise predict function) ok
+ roxygen with bibtex -> not supported ok
+ init_values: fct corr (warnings) ok
+ deal with warnings ? ok?
+ more examples
+ two further applications (wage + BLP)
+ remove keywords ok


* long-term goals:  
+ Support of Sparse Matrix  
+ glm-family (logit own implementation, Poisson, ...)
+ Treatment effects: "functional implementation"
+ Automatic generation of orthogonalized function
+ Optimization speed + memory
+ better error messages
